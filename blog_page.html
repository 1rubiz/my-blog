                     in the school calender. Most schools turned to unline learning to continue their
                     lessons. Digital platforms that connected people together were utilized along
                     side various devices such as phones, tablets, laptops etc . This ensured the 
                     continous flow of learning.

                     Humans naturally are known as social organisms and therefore need to
                     constantly keep in touch with each other. This also was impeded by the 
                     pandemic. The lock-down and social distancing hindered normal contact,
                     but with the aid of our telecommunication devices, we could keep tabs on
                     family and friends all around the world.

                     Over the years, most ceremonial pictures and videos were covered by camera-men
                     who were on the field. This however had several range limitations but these 
                     limitations are now being aided with drones providing arial/vantage view.
